## Development

### Docker

To run the project locally, you can use Docker. First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone
cd progresspal
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```bash
DEBUG=1
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost 127.0.0.1 [::1]
DATABASE_URL=postgres://progresspal:progresspalpass@db/progresspaldb
```

Then, run with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build 
```

Note: ``--build`` is only required when you want to rebuild the image.

You then need to migrate the database:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
